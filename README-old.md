spevnik2: the second attempt at my awesome html5 songbook
=========================================================

This thing might one day become a neat, touch-friendly, and human-friendly songbook/sheet music organizer written as an HTML5 offline app.

The Plan
--------

- it should have an almost paper-like feeling, at least in being minimal - no distractions
- it should make use of the fact that it is not paper (e.g. powerful search, display optimized for viewing rather than saving paper, etc.)
- it should be easy to use and convenient for both me and a less computer-savvy person
- it should work offline
- it should work across all devices with modern browsers
- it is *not* planned to be in a working state anytime soon

Extensible!
-----------

Even supposedly core parts (like displaying text/sheet music/guitar tabs) will actually be a form of plugins. Therefore, I will be forced to create a decoupled design, so it should be really easy to extend the functionality in just about any imaginable way. I would like to end up maintaining this and not hating this at the same time, so I'd better do this well :D

Why all this
------------

The main reason why I am doing this is that I want to (1) try to write a semi-serious web app, (2) learn about all the new html5 awesomeness and (3) get closer to becoming the Javascript Jedi I'd like to be.
